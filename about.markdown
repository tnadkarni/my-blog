Hi, my name is Tanya Nadkarni. Welcome to my blog! I am a Marketing Analytics professional and while my job does involve gathering insights through data, I am looking to improve my coding skills through online courses and personal projects,specifically but not limited to Python with applications in Machine Learning and Data Visualization.
