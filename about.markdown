Hey there! My name is Tanya Nadkarni. Welcome to my website. I am a Marketing Analytics professional with 3+ years' experience and looking to expand my skill base through online courses and personal data science projects.

I am specifically interested in developing coding skills in Python, R, SQL and concepts in Machine Learning and Statistics for application in Predictive Modeling and Visualization projects.

Here's a link to my [Resume]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/Resume_TanyaN.pdf)
